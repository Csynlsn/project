    <p>Batch Life (Established 20XX) is owned and operated by Vivian Crane-Conant, a local artist and Seattle native. 
What started as a playful pet name amongst friends (“Batch”) quickly turned into a lifestyle. 
After years of making unique jewelry and art for herself, friends, and family, Vivian decided to open up a small business 
selling her wares to other "Batches".</p>
